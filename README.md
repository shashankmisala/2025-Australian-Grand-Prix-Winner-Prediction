# Australian Grand Prix 2025 Race Winner Predictor
## Predicting Race Performance Using Machine Learning and Formula 1 Data

## Overview
This project predicts the race winner for the 2025 Australian Grand Prix. By analyzing the relationship between qualifying times and race performance from the 2024 season, I built a predictive model using Gradient Boosting Regressor. The model leverages historical Formula 1 data to forecast how drivers will perform in the 2025 race based on their qualifying results.

## This project demonstrates :

#### Work with real-world, domain-specific data.

#### Build and evaluate machine learning models.

#### Deliver actionable insights through data-driven predictions.

## How It Works
### Data Collection:

Race data from the 2024 Australian Grand Prix and qualifying data from the 2025 Australian Grand Prix are fetched using the fastf1 library.

### Data Preprocessing:

Lap times are converted from timedelta objects to seconds.

Datasets are cleaned, merged, and prepared for machine learning.

### Model Training:

A Gradient Boosting Regressor is trained on the 2024 race data to predict race times based on qualifying times.

### Prediction:

The model predicts race times for the 2025 Australian Grand Prix using the qualifying times.

## Results:

The predicted race times are sorted and displayed, along with the model's performance metrics (e.g., MAE).
